Lordscales91's Maven Repo
===

I'm migrating my maven repo from Dropbox since I've received an email informing me that Dropbox is closing down Public folder service. You can read about it [here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13188848).

It's a shame that this useful feature will gone soon... But we need to move on.
